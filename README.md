- Please submit any demos into /offline-demos
- I need help with the following issues:
    - Demos in /offline-demos need to be properly organised into respective /public_html/tournaments directories
    - public_html/js/tournaments.js is becoming monolithic, I need a cleaner approach, perhaps one json per tournament in a new directory
        - Risk of duplicate zip filenames needs to be addressed in tournaments.js
