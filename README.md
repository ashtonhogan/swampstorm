- Please submit any demos into /offline-demos
- I need help with the following issues:
    - Demos in /offline-demos need to be properly organised into respective /public_html/tournaments directories
    - public_html/js/tournaments.js is becoming monolithic, I need a cleaner approach, perhaps one json per tournament in a new directory
    - I need a directory which contains resources for each team, including all versions of their past and present logos. The images in /public_html/tournaments need to then be removed.
